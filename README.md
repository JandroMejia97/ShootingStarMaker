# #SPACEAPPS2019

Hello! we are **_ SERENDIPIA _** a group formed by students of Mechanical Engineering, computer engineering, plastic arts, multimedia design and a creative informatic.
In this edition of the _NASA International Space Apps Challenge_ we will address the challenge **"Orbital scrap metal - The video game"**

## Why do we choose this challenge?

We understood that the problem of space debris is a matter of rigor which must be dealt with shortly and on which, in our opinion, no specific policies are being carried out in order to solve it.
The amount of space debris increases year by year because of the frequency with which objects are sent to space and this will continue to increase even if it is stopped due to the possible collision of those already in orbit.

## Goals

In addition to meeting the objectives proposed by the challenge, we consider that the development of the video game is based on solutions whose feasibility of realization is the focus of discussion today.

## Development

As a starting point to carry out the video game, we worked on data obtained through the **NASA SPACEBIRDS** platform, which were the speed at which they travel, how far from the earth they are and their continuity, seeking show them on screen to the user.
The videogame is based on the player's control of a space garbage collection satellite, which will operate in the range of orbits **LEO** (low Earth orbit). We decided to place its development in this orbit given that more than 70% of the local space debris is in it and it is cheaper to send satellites there compared to, for example, orbit ** GEO **.
The objective will be to collect small objects. From 101 mm. (4 in.) Objects begin to be detected by _United States Space Surveillance Agency_ and therefore, know their location in real time.

Aware that at present the only way to move through space is by means of mass impulse. Our ship will eject a part of the collected particles, to be able to stay in orbit and move to other superiors. If necessary, propel themselves to lower orbits, it will have a system that does not require this type of propulsion since the particles would move away from the atmosphere and would not be incinerated.
It will be assumed that all satellite systems will be powered by solar energy.
It will take into account the fact that being in the same orbit as another object, the distance between it and our satellite will not vary because they will be traveling at the same speed.
In order to exemplify and insentivate users to think about projects with an economic purpose that serve as a solution to the problem, the rest of the mass collected will be used as raw material in a venture to sell shooting stars on demand, which will be a product to propel the charge into the atmosphere and be incinerated by it, generating the desired beam of light.
